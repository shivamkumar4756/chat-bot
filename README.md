# Simple Python Chatbot

This is a basic Python chatbot that demonstrates how to create a chatbot using a dictionary of predefined responses. It provides responses based on user input and includes a default response for unrecognized queries.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.

2. Run the `chatbot.py` file using Python.

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the responses in the `responses` dictionary in the `chatbot.py` file. Add or edit responses as needed to suit your requirements.

```bash
responses = {
    "hello": ["Hey! I am the chatbot of SkillSync Interns."],
    "how are you": ["I'm good, thanks!", "I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help!"],
    "bye": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Have a great day!"],
    "default": ["I'm not sure what you mean.", "Could you please rephrase that?", "I don't understand."]
}
```
